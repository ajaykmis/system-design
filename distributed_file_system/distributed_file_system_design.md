# Design a Distributed File System

**Staff Engineer System Design Interview**  
*Estimated Duration: 45-60 minutes*

---

## Understanding the Problem

### üóÇÔ∏è What is a Distributed File System?
A distributed file system (DFS) is a storage system that spreads data across multiple machines in a network, presenting a unified interface to clients. Unlike traditional file systems that store data on a single machine, distributed file systems scale horizontally across many nodes to handle massive datasets, provide fault tolerance, and support concurrent access from thousands of clients. Examples include HDFS, Google File System (GFS), and Amazon S3.

## Functional Requirements

### Core Requirements
1. **File Operations**: Clients should be able to create, read, write, update, and delete files
2. **Hierarchical Namespace**: Support directory structures with nested folders
3. **Large File Support**: Handle files ranging from KB to TB in size
4. **Concurrent Access**: Multiple clients should be able to access files simultaneously
5. **Metadata Operations**: Support file/directory listing, permissions, and attributes

### Core Requirements
1. **High Availability**: System remains operational despite node failures
2. **Scalability**: Horizontally scalable to handle growing data and traffic
3. **Durability**: Data should not be lost (99.999999999% durability)
4. **Performance**: Low latency for metadata operations (<10ms), reasonable throughput for data operations

### Below the line (out of scope)
- Strong consistency guarantees
- Multi-region replication
- Advanced caching strategies
- Detailed monitoring/observability

---

## Planning the Approach

*As a staff engineer, immediately establish the interview direction*

**Time Allocation Strategy** (45-60 min interview):
- **Problem Understanding & Requirements**: 5-8 minutes
- **High-Level Design**: 8-12 minutes  
- **Deep Dives** (most critical): 25-35 minutes
- **Additional Considerations**: 5-8 minutes

**Key Decision**: This design will focus on a GFS-style architecture optimized for large files and high throughput, balancing between architectural overview and deep technical discussions expected at staff level.

---

## Core Entities

**Primary Entities**:
- **Files**: Stored as sequences of fixed-size chunks (typically 64MB)
- **Chunks**: Fixed-size blocks of data with unique identifiers
- **Metadata**: File/directory structure, chunk locations, permissions
- **Directories**: Hierarchical namespace organization

**Key Relationships**:
- Files are split into multiple chunks
- Each chunk is replicated across multiple chunk servers
- Metadata service maintains file-to-chunk mappings

---

## API Design

*Keep this section brief for staff interviews - focus on core operations*

```
# File Operations
POST /files/{path}           # Create file
GET /files/{path}            # Read file  
PUT /files/{path}            # Update file
DELETE /files/{path}         # Delete file

# Directory Operations  
POST /directories/{path}     # Create directory
GET /directories/{path}      # List directory
DELETE /directories/{path}   # Delete directory

# Metadata Operations
GET /metadata/{path}         # Get file/dir metadata
PUT /metadata/{path}         # Update metadata
```

---

## High-Level Design

### Architecture Overview

Our distributed file system follows a master-slave architecture with clear separation of metadata and data operations:

** Architecture **
![myimage](dfs.png?raw=true)

```
[Clients] ‚Üí [Metadata Service] (file locations)
    ‚Üì
[Chunk Servers] (actual data storage)
```

### Core Components

1. **Metadata Service (Master)**
   - Maintains file system namespace
   - Stores file-to-chunk mappings  
   - Manages chunk server health
   - Handles chunk allocation and replication

2. **Chunk Servers (Data Nodes)**
   - Store actual file data as fixed-size chunks
   - Handle read/write operations for chunks
   - Report health status to metadata service

3. **Client Library**
   - Provides file system interface to applications
   - Handles metadata lookups and data operations
   - Implements caching and batching optimizations

### Basic Flow

1. **Write Operation**:
   - Client contacts metadata service for chunk allocation
   - Metadata service assigns chunk servers and returns chunk handles
   - Client writes data directly to assigned chunk servers
   - Chunk servers confirm write completion

2. **Read Operation**:
   - Client queries metadata service for chunk locations
   - Metadata service returns chunk handles and server locations
   - Client reads data directly from chunk servers

## Deep Dives

*This is where staff engineers spend most of their time*

### 1) How do we ensure metadata consistency and availability?

The metadata service is the brain of our system, making its design critical for overall system reliability.

**Challenge**: The metadata service becomes a single point of failure and bottleneck.

**Solution: Replicated State Machine with Consensus**

We'll implement a **Raft consensus-based metadata cluster**:

- **Leader Election**: One metadata server acts as the leader, handling all writes
- **Log Replication**: All metadata changes are logged and replicated to followers  
- **Fault Tolerance**: System continues operating with majority of nodes available

**Implementation Details**:
```
Metadata Cluster (3-5 nodes using Raft):
- Leader handles all writes (file creation, deletion, metadata updates)
- Followers can serve read requests for better read scalability
- Write operations require majority consensus
- Leader lease mechanism prevents split-brain scenarios
```

**Trade-offs**:
- **Pros**: Strong consistency for metadata, automatic failover, proven consensus algorithm
- **Cons**: Write latency increased due to consensus overhead, complexity in implementation

**Alternative Approaches**:
- **Master-Slave with Manual Failover**: Simpler but requires human intervention
- **Distributed Hash Table**: Better scalability but eventual consistency challenges

### 2) How do we handle chunk placement and replication?

**Challenge**: We need to ensure data durability while optimizing for performance and storage efficiency.

**Solution: Intelligent Chunk Placement Strategy**

**Replication Strategy**:
- **Default Replication Factor**: 3 copies per chunk
- **Rack-aware Placement**: Replicas distributed across different racks/availability zones
- **Load-based Selection**: Choose chunk servers based on current load and available space

**Chunk Allocation Process**:
1. Client requests chunk allocation from metadata service
2. Metadata service selects primary chunk server (lowest load, sufficient space)
3. Primary chunk server selected based on:
   - Available disk space (>10% free)
   - Current load (CPU, memory, network utilization)
   - Network proximity to client
4. Secondary replicas placed on different racks for fault tolerance

**Code Example**:
```python
class ChunkPlacementManager:
    def allocate_chunk(self, file_path, chunk_index):
        # Select primary based on load balancing
        primary = self.select_primary_server()
        
        # Select replicas in different racks
        replicas = self.select_replica_servers(
            primary, 
            replication_factor=3,
            rack_diversity=True
        )
        
        chunk_id = generate_chunk_id(file_path, chunk_index)
        return ChunkAllocation(chunk_id, primary, replicas)
```

### 3) How do we handle large file operations efficiently?

**Challenge**: Large files (GB-TB range) create challenges for atomic operations, network transfer, and storage efficiency.

**Solution: Chunking with Pipelining and Parallel Operations**

**Chunking Strategy**:
- **Fixed Chunk Size**: 64MB chunks (configurable)
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple chunks processed simultaneously
- **Pipeline Writes**: Data flows through replica chain for efficiency

**Large File Write Process**:
1. Client library splits large file into 64MB chunks
2. Multiple chunks written in parallel (up to 10 concurrent streams)
3. Each chunk follows pipeline replication:
   ```
   Client ‚Üí Primary ‚Üí Secondary1 ‚Üí Secondary2
   ```
4. Client receives acknowledgment only after all replicas confirm write

**Optimization Techniques**:
- **Write Pipelining**: Next chunk starts writing while current chunk replicates
- **Client-side Buffering**: 256MB write buffer to optimize network usage
- **Compression**: Optional on-the-fly compression for text/log files

**Handling Failures During Large Writes**:
- **Chunk-level Recovery**: Failed chunks can be retried without restarting entire file
- **Partial Write Tracking**: Metadata service tracks completion status per chunk
- **Cleanup Process**: Background process removes orphaned incomplete chunks

### 4) How do we ensure data consistency across replicas?

**Challenge**: Maintaining consistency across chunk replicas while supporting concurrent access.

**Solution: Primary-Backup Replication with Version Control**

**Consistency Model**:
- **Write Consistency**: All writes go through primary replica first
- **Read Consistency**: Clients can read from any replica (eventual consistency)
- **Conflict Resolution**: Version vectors handle concurrent updates

**Write Process**:
1. Client sends write request to primary chunk server
2. Primary assigns version number and writes locally
3. Primary forwards write to all secondary replicas
4. Primary responds to client after majority acknowledgment
5. Lagging replicas catch up asynchronously

**Version Control Mechanism**:
```python
class ChunkVersion:
    def __init__(self):
        self.version = 0
        self.checksum = None
        self.timestamp = None
    
    def update(self, data):
        self.version += 1
        self.checksum = calculate_checksum(data)
        self.timestamp = current_time()
```

**Handling Replica Divergence**:
- **Checksum Verification**: Regular integrity checks detect corrupted replicas
- **Version Comparison**: Clients verify version numbers before reads
- **Repair Process**: Background service identifies and fixes inconsistent replicas

### 5) How do we handle chunk server failures and recovery?

**Challenge**: Chunk servers will fail, and we need automatic detection and recovery without data loss.

**Solution: Heartbeat Monitoring with Automated Re-replication**

**Failure Detection**:
- **Heartbeat Protocol**: Chunk servers send periodic heartbeats (every 30 seconds) to metadata service
- **Timeout Detection**: Metadata service marks servers as failed after 3 missed heartbeats
- **Health Metrics**: Include disk space, load, and error rates in heartbeats

**Recovery Process**:
1. **Immediate Response**: Metadata service removes failed server from active pool
2. **Under-replicated Detection**: Identify all chunks with insufficient replicas
3. **Priority-based Recovery**: Prioritize chunks with fewer surviving replicas
4. **Re-replication**: Create new replicas on healthy chunk servers

**Recovery Optimization**:
- **Bandwidth Throttling**: Limit recovery traffic to avoid overwhelming network
- **Source Selection**: Choose healthiest replica as source for re-replication  
- **Batch Processing**: Group multiple chunks for efficient recovery

**Code Example**:
```python
class FailureRecoveryManager:
    def handle_server_failure(self, failed_server):
        # Mark server as failed
        self.mark_server_failed(failed_server)
        
        # Find under-replicated chunks
        under_replicated = self.find_under_replicated_chunks(failed_server)
        
        # Prioritize by replication level
        priority_queue = self.prioritize_chunks(under_replicated)
        
        # Start recovery process
        self.start_recovery_process(priority_queue)
```
